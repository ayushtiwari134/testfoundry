# TestFoundry — Autonomous Test Generation & Execution for Any Codebase  

**TestFoundry** is an open-source, multi-agent CLI system that analyzes your entire codebase, forges complete test suites (unit, integration, property-based, edge-case), and runs them in an isolated environment — producing a clean, developer-friendly test report.

Build once. Drop into any project. Turn your entire repo into a fully-tested, production-grade system.

**Work in Progress — Active Development**
TestFoundry is currently under active development and rapidly evolving.  
APIs, CLI commands, internal architecture, and folder structures may change as the system matures.

If you're exploring the repo early, expect active updates, new features, and frequent improvements.
